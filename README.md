## FastBuild: Supercharge Your FastAPI Development

FastBuild is a command-line tool designed to supercharge the creation of FastAPI-based web applications. It provides a standardized, best-practice project structure and streamlines the integration of essential features, empowering developers to focus on building core application logic rather than tedious project scaffolding.

## Key Features

* **Lightning-Fast Project Initialization:** Bootstrap a fully functional FastAPI project in seconds with a single, intuitive command.
* **Modular and On-Demand Feature Integration:** Add RESTful endpoints, database support (with SQLAlchemy), and other core features only when needed. Avoid bloated dependencies and keep your project lean.
* **Robust and Adaptable Configuration:** Use `settings.yaml` along with Dynaconf for flexible configuration management. Easily switch between environments (dev, test, prod) with minimal hassle.
* **User-Friendly CLI:** Simplifies project setup, database config, and other common tasks — letting you focus on coding, not configs.
* **Best-Practice Project Structure:** Generated projects follow FastAPI best practices, promoting clean architecture, maintainability, and scalability.
* **Extensible and Customizable:** Built to be extended. Customize it to fit your team’s standards or personal preferences without reinventing the wheel.

## Installation

```bash
pip install fastbuild
```

## Getting Started

After installation, you can initialize a new FastAPI project with:

```bash
fastbuild init-project
```

This will create a new directory (named after your project) with the basic FastAPI project structure. Navigate into the new directory:

```bash
cd <your_project_name>
```

Then, you can start the development server:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Available Commands

FastBuild offers a suite of helpful commands:

  * `fastbuild init-project`: Initializes a new FastAPI project with the standard structure.
  * `fastbuild add-db`: Adds database support using SQLAlchemy and Sqlmodel.
  * `fastbuild remove-db`: Removes database setup and configuration files.
  * `fastbuild run-app`: Runs the FastAPI development server.
  * `fastbuild version`: Shows the current version of FastBuild.
